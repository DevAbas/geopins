# GeooPins

### Full-stack CRUD app allowing logged-in users to place pins on a map (with photo and description), view others' pins, and comment on pins...all updated in real time. All pins are saved to a database. Local storage is used to save user's previous map location for improved UX and load times when revisiting site.

### Libraries and services used...

- Mapbox
- React (hooks, React Router, react-map-gl)
- Material UI
- Google OAuth 2.0
- Geolocation API
- Cloudinary for image hosting
- Apollo GraphQL server and client (including subscriptions)
- Node / Express
- MongoDB Atlas / Mongoose
- etc...

> NOTE: I created this project for practice.
